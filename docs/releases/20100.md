# 2019.11.2 Liorsmagic v20.1
Lots of bug fixes from v20.0, and some cool new features!

### Updated Liorsmagic Manager Hiding
Starting with Liorsmagic v20.1 paired with Liorsmagic Manager v7.4.0, a new hiding mode is introduced for Android 9.0+. On supported devices, Liorsmagic Manager will download and customize a heavily obfuscated stub APK and use it as a replacement. The stub app will then download the full app into its private internal data, then dynamically load and run the actual full Liorsmagic Manager.

Note, not all Android 9.0+ devices will be able to use this feature. To use an obfuscated stub as Liorsmagic Manager, the Liorsmagic daemon will have to rely on a special way to communicate with the app, and some OEMs (most likely Chinese manufacturers) block certain broadcasts, breaking the communication channel.

Liorsmagic Manager will verify compatibility before it uses stubs to hide itself on Android 9.0+. **The verification relies on Liorsmagic v20.1+, which means you have to fully upgrade and reboot in order to opt in this feature.** If you are already running a hidden Liorsmagic Manager, **restore and upgrade Liorsmagic Manager, upgrade Liorsmagic and reboot, then re-hide the app**.

For those incompatible with the hiding-with-stub feature, there are also a few updates that everyone, regardless whether using stubs or not, can enjoy:

- You can now customize the app name of the repackaged Liorsmagic Manager
- Liorsmagic Manager will generate new keys to sign the repackaged APK to prevent signature detection
