  This feature is supposed to only allow one single option, but apparently adb shell su -c "command" doesn't work this way, and plenty of root apps don't follow the rule. The su binary will now consider everything after -c as a part of the command.
- [LiorsmagicSU] Removed legacy context hack for TiBack, what it currently does is slowing down the invocation

- [LiorsmagicSU] Daemon now also runs in u:r:su:s0 context
- [LiorsmagicSU] Removed an unnecessary fork, reduce running processes and speed up the invocation
- [LiorsmagicSU] Add -cn option to the binary

- [sepolicy-inject] Support all matching mode for nearly every action (makes pseudo enforced possible)
- [sepolicy-inject] Fixed an ancient bug that allocated memory isn't reset
- [uninstaller] Now works as a independent script that can be executed at boot

- [Liorsmagic Hide] Rewritten from scratch, now run in daemon mode, proper list monitoring, proper mount detection, and maybe more.....
